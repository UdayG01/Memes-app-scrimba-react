# 🖼️ Memes-app-scrimba-react
This repository stores my practice of creating and modifying the Memes Generator app as guided in React.js course distributed by scrimba.com and taught by Bob Ziroll.

## :bulb: Key Highlights
* This meme generator uses the concept of react hooks, hence bringing in the elements of a dynamic web app.
* I've used the use-state and use-effect hooks to dynamically change the text marked on the memes and make API calls for the meme images.
